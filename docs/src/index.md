## Control Your Own Data

### True Data Ownership

### No More Lost Data

Feel safe about the longevity of your files and avoid the horror stories of broken hard drives, deleted accounts, or lost files.

### Decentralized Network

Break free from Big Tech and leverage the power of the decentralized Arweave blockchain network that puts you back in control. Own your data instead of renting it.

### Community Owned

*You're the boss.*  As a Web3 organization, ArDrive is owned collectively so you can have a say in our governance and share in our rewards.
