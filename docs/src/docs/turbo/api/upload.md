# Upload API

## Overview

The Turbo Upload Service supports payment for signed data-items to upload.ardrive.io using Turbo Credits. An API endpoint has been created to facilitate the payments. A signed data-item can be posted to upload.ardrive.io using the below schema.

**Note**: This service is still evolving and the information provided below may be out of date. You can view the most up to date information about the available endpoints [here](https://upload.ardrive.io/api-docs), or view the raw json for that documentation [here](https://upload.ardrive.io/openapi.json).


## Endpoint

`https://upload.ardrive.io/v1/tx`

## Schema

### Headers

`content-type`*: "application/octet-stream"

`accept`*: string - media type, such as "application/json" 

### Body

The body of your request should contain a signed data-item. 

Data-items can be created and signed with the arbundles library, following the below example.

```
// Initiates the arbundles Arweave signer with your wallet
const signer = new ArweaveSigner(jwk);

// Sets the data you would like to use to create a data-item
const data = "Any value can Go here";

// Creates a data-item using your data and the Arweave Signer
const dataItem = createData(data, signer);

// Signs the data-item
await dataItem.sign(signer);

```

In this example, the variable `dataItem` is what should be sent in your api post request in order to finalize and pay for the upload using Turbo Credits. `dataItem.sign()` is a mutating method, so there is no need to create a separate variable to hold the results of signing the data-item.
