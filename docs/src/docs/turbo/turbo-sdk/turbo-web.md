# Using Turbo SDK in a Browser Environment

## Overview

With Turbo-SDK [v1.3.0](release-notes.md#v130), You can authenticate a Turbo instance by passing in an arweave signer instance instead of JWK. This supports the `ArweaveSigner` or `ArconnectSigner` classes from [arbundles](https://github.com/Irys-xyz/arbundles).
