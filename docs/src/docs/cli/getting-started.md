# Getting Started

To simply install the latest version of the CLI to your local system and get started, follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start) instructions. To build and/or develop the CLI from source, follow the [Build and Run from Source](#build-from-source) instructions. In either case, be sure to satisfy the requirements in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

## Prerequisites

The following tools must be installed whether performing a [Quick Start](#quick-start) or [Building from Source](#build-from-source):

### Git

Some of ArDrive's dependencies are transitively installed via Git. Install it, if necessary, and ensure that it's available within your terminal environment:

[Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### NVM (Optional - Recommended)<a id="nvm"></a>

This project uses the Node Version Manager (NVM) and an `.nvmrc` file to lock the recommended Node version used by the latest version of `ardrive-core-js`.

**Note for Windows: We recommend using WSL for setting up NVM on Windows using the [instructions described here][wsl-install]**

Follow these steps to get NVM up and running on your system:

1. Install NVM using [these installation instructions][nvm-install].
2. Navigate to this project's root directory
3. Ensure that the correct version of Node is installed by performing: `nvm install`
4. Use the correct version of Node, by performing: `nvm use`

**IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU AVOID GENERATING WALLETS VIA SEED PHRASE WITH THE CLI USING ANY NODE VERSION OTHER THAN THE ONE SPECIFIED IN `.nvmrc`.**

## Quick Start

Once you've satisfied any necessary [prerequisites](#prerequisites), the fastest way to get up and running is to globally install the latest version of the ArDrive CLI to your local system via NPM:

### Installing and Starting the CLI From NPM Package<a id="install-from-npm"></a>

```shell
npm install -g ardrive-cli

# then invoke the CLI from anywhere on your system:
ardrive
```

### Upgrading to the Latest Version<a id="upgrading"></a>

If you globally installed the CLI via NPM, then upgrade to the latest version by simply performing:

```shell
npm update -g ardrive-cli
```

## Build and Run from Source<a id="build-from-source"></a>

### Install Yarn 3<a id="yarn3"></a>

Both the ArDrive CLI and ArDrive Core JS use Yarn 3 to manage dependencies and initiate workflows, so follow the [yarn installation instructions][yarn-install] in order to get the latest version. In most cases:

```shell
# Brew (OSX):
brew install yarn

# Or with NPM (all supported platforms):
npm install -g yarn
```

### Husky (Developers Only)<a id="husky"></a>

We use husky 6.x to manage the git commit hooks that help to improve the quality of our commits. Please run:

```shell
yarn husky install
```

to enable git hooks for your local checkout. Without doing so, you risk committing non-compliant code to the repository.

### Using a custom ArDrive-Core-JS (Optional)<a id="custom-ardrive-core-js"></a>

To test a with a custom version of the `ardrive-core-js` library on your local system, change the `"ardrive-core-js"` line in `package.json` to the root of your local `ardrive-core-js` repo:

```diff
- "ardrive-core-js": "1.0.0"
+ "ardrive-core-js": "../ardrive-core-js/"
```

### Installing and Starting the CLI From Source<a id="install-from-src"></a>

Now that your runtime and/or development environment is set up, to install the package simply run:

```shell
yarn && yarn build
```

And then start the CLI (always from the root of this repository):

```shell
yarn ardrive
```

For convenience in the **non-developer case**, you can install the CLI globally on your system by performing the following step:

```shell
yarn pack

# then using the path generated by yarn from the step above:
npm install i -g /path/to/package.tgz

# then invoke the CLI from anywhere on your system:
ardrive
```

### Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions (Developers Only)<a id="vs-extensions"></a>

To ensure your environment is compatible, we also recommend the following VSCode extensions:

-   [ES-Lint][eslint-vscode]
-   [Editor-Config][editor-config-vscode]
-   [Prettier][prettier-vscode]
-   [ZipFS][zipfs-vscode]
